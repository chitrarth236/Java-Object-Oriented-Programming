## Encapsulation

The process of grouping data members and correspoding methods into a signle unit is called encapsulation.

Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods.

Encapsulation can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data and code is tightly controlled by an interface.

The main benefit of encapsulation is the ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code. With this feature Encapsulation gives maintainability, flexibility and extensibility to our code.
